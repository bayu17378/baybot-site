# BayBot – Automated Trading Bot (Frontend Demo)

This repository showcases the frontend design and system architecture
of an automated crypto trading bot.

## Project Overview
BayBot is a personal project focused on:
- Automated trading logic
- Risk management visualization
- Separation between frontend, backend, and execution layer

This repository intentionally contains frontend-only code.

## System Design
- Frontend: Static HTML/CSS/JS (GitHub Pages)
- Backend: Private (API & bot engine not published)
- Exchange: Spot & Futures (conceptual)

## Security Considerations
- No API keys stored in frontend
- Backend intentionally excluded
- Demo data only

## Features Demonstrated
- Bot status monitoring
- Balance & equity tracking
- Entry, SL, TP visualization
- Error handling UI

## ⚠️ Disclaimer
